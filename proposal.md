# Playlistic App Proposal

## Project Description

Playlistic is a new mobile app in which user c​urated​ p​laylists​ via Spotify, Apple Music, Soundcloud, Tidal, and other top streaming services, are aggregated and shared in one unique environment/experience.

## Problem Statement

The internet has become the number one source for music discovery over the past few years. For decades, music lovers relied heavily on radio DJs and personalities to find out about new artists and music. Today, users simply go online and access a massively diverse collection of music with a few clicks of the mouse, and mobile applications make tapping into this ever­-growing resource as easy as reaching for your mobile device.

An aggregation utility that permits its users to share their music experiences across the various platforms needs to be created, and it is certainly the most logical progression through the streaming landscape. ​Playlistic is a platform built for consumers to share the treasured playlists that they have created, utilizing the top streaming services. It is our mission to foster a socially ­engaged community, much like Instagram for playlists, by facilitating open listening experiences amongst consumers, tastemakers, and artists. In a world where much of what we read, see, or listen to online is determined by algorithms, Playlistic focuses on the unrivaled power of human curation.

The playlist has emerged as a leading industry feature as curation by real people far surpasses machine algorithms in building particular vibes or themes. As businesses adapt to this change, it is conceivable that a new industry and new business models will arise. The streaming providers are currently deadlocked in competition and the music consumer is suffering for it. Playlistic is primed to launch as the primary destination for shareable user­ curated playlists, aggregated by the industry’s top streaming providers. We will disrupt the industry, minimize the giants and reconstruct the rigid walls of exclusivity erected by the streaming providers in order to safeguard their brands. If the streaming providers are the new major labels, we are the new music distribution model.

* They don’t own much in the way of music

* The “Groovy” Listener

* Likes the sound of the music and does not really focus on the lyrics as much, but it has a good beat, then they are into it
* If it has a catchy chorus, it does not really matter what the song is about, they will like it

* The “Critical” Listener

* Really listens to and analyzes lyrics, cares about the whole package
delivery
* Pays close attention to the growth of an artist throughout their career
